# About this project 

This project delves into the impact of regulatory measures on Airbnb listings in Paris, with a focus on pricing dynamics, neighborhood variations, and market shifts over time. 
The primary goals were to identify the factors that influenced pricing, analyze pricing trends across different neighborhoods, and assess the effects of the 2015 regulations on the number of available listings.

Using Python, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of historical Airbnb data for Paris. The study revealed key insights:

#### Market Growth: 
Airbnb listings in Paris grew exponentially from its inception, peaking in 2015 with over 12,000 listings. However, as the market became more competitive, average prices started to decrease.

#### Neighborhood Pricing: 
The analysis showed that pricing varied significantly by neighborhood, with some areas commanding higher nightly rates due to their location, amenities, and demand. This granular look at neighborhood pricing provided a deeper understanding of what drives Airbnb rates in Paris.

#### Regulatory Impact: 
In response to concerns about rising housing costs, the Parisian government introduced regulations in 2015, leading to a significant reduction in listings. By 2020, listings had bottomed out at under 4,000.

#### Pricing Trends Post-Regulation:
With fewer listings post-regulation, competition decreased, and average nightly prices surged, peaking at 140 Euros in 2020â€”a 40 Euro increase from 2015.
